5 > 8 is false, so the expression after the colon (:) is evaluated.

2 < 5 is true (because 2 is indeed less than 5).

Now, the expression becomes 1 != true. Since true is considered as 1.

1 != 1, which is false.

So, the overall expression 1 != 2 < 5 is false.

Since the condition 1 != 2 < 5 is false, the part after the colon (:) is chosen, which is 30.

Therefore, x = 30.
